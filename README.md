# a4AmSchedule

Nothing fancy, limited field validation, but provides the flexibility to specify the amortization period.

* Pick the amortization period and the compounding period (monthly for US style, semi-annual for Canadian).
* Calculate the monthly payment, show the schedule.
* Provide an over-ride monthly payment that is greater than the calculated payment in order to make extra principal payments.
